## Udacity Front-End Nanodegree
# Feed-Reader Testing
____________________________
Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript.
The thing I like the most is that it has clean syntax, and that makes writing tests easy.

```html
describe("A suite", function() {
  it("contains spec with an expectation", function() {
    expect(true).toBe(true);
  });
});
```
